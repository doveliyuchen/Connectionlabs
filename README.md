The intention of this project is to notice people global warming and extreme weather. Recent news of flooding in US and flooding in China really altered me about the weather issue worldwide. I am living in Zhengzhou where it got a bad flood on July 20th. My family didn’t get influenced so much, but many other families were influenced so much that they lost internet connectivity, clean water, and electricity. Some of them even need to move away from their house and live in a hotel for a while. The inspiration of this project is from some basic data visualization projects. I researched some popular projects of data visualization projects, and I know d3 is a little different from other JavaScript language, so I also learn online abut bar chart. 
The decision of using d3 is because I think I need to combine map with the bar chat and make it interactive. If it needs more data to process, d3 is the best language. However, in this project, the data is really hard to find. I finally find some data on National Centers for Environmental Information.It has a global temperature change in different area from 1981 to 2020. The data is also downloadable on this website. 
The challenged part of this project is the script. I made this in D3, and the bars should be rectangles. However, there are many negative data, and the length of the rectangles couldn’t be negative. I should find another way to process the data to separate the negative and positive data. Then make them draw in different directions. 
Lessons that I really learn about are that I should find the data first and understand the data. It is not an easy thing to process the data. The negative part of the data will cause problems. I also need to research more about the d3 tutorials for negative data. I also should give people more about the context and the data to help them understand it.
